# face-mesh-generator
Generate face mesh dataset using Google's FaceMesh model from annotated face datasets.

You can find the supported datasets list here:
https://github.com/yinguobing/facial-landmark-dataset

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
* OpenCV 4.3
* TensorFlow 2.2

### Installing
First clone this repo.

```bash
# From your favorite development directory
git clone https://github.com/yinguobing/face-mesh-generator.git
```

Then download Google's FaceMesh tflite model and put it in the `assets` directory.

Model link: https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/mediapipe/models/face_landmark.tflite

## How to run
Take WFLW as an example. Download the dataset files from the official website. Extract all files to one directory.

First, Construct the dataset.
```bash
ds_wflw = fmd.wflw.WFLW("wflw")
ds_wflw.populate_dataset(wflw_dir)
```
`wflw_dir` is the directory for the extracted files.

Then, process the dataset.
```bash
process(ds_wflw)
```

There is a demo file `generate_dataset.py`. Please refer to it for more details.
